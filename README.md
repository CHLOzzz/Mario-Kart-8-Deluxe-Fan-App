# Mario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Fan-App
A fun Android app for Mario Kart 8 Deluxe fans meant to act as convienience for features not natively present in the base game. Android 5.0+

Features include a built-in randomizer, and stats table using up-to-date statistics as of August 4, 2023.

Upcoming features I'm planning are bulk randomization when playing with friends, adding sorting features to the stats tables, and generally cleaning up the app for ease of use.

All data & assets sourced from https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8_Deluxe_in-game_statistics#Statistics_translation_tables and https://wallpapersafari.com/mario-kart-8-wallpapers-iphone/

The app is meant to be intuitive to use so no intstructions should be necessary. :)
